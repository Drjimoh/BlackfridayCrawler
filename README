Well I just thought there should be a way of crawling through jumia pages and 
finding the best deals in the predicted heat of the upcoming black friday within a short period of time (error free too),
I have goodnews and bad news, goodnews first: as at when I wrote this program, jumia's robot.txt file has nothing on my spiders,
so I created a spider i called Aragog, Aragog was able to crawl 11 jumia pages within 26.93 seconds and I have excel files with 
items and their discount percentage (I used a threshold of 50% discount). The badnews is this, you will have to buy me a bottle of 
non-alcoholic beer if you want me to refactor my code for you. 


Gracias muy bien.
Me gustaria una taza de cafe con leche.
